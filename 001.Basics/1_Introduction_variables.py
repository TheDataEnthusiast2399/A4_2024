# Variables --->
# What are variables?
# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
"""
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name 
(age, carname, total_volume). 
Rules for Python variables:
1) A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
2) A variable name cannot start with a number.
3) A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4) Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
5) A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
